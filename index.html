          <h3>Hobbies And Intrests. </h3>
          <p>Creativity really fascinates me ever since I was a little kid. Taking things apart to figure how they work and building something new or ending up destroying them completely while learning in the process has always been a part of me. I love watching sports such has Fourmula 1 and football. I support Mercedes-AMG  Formula One Team and Lewis Hamilton is my driver. If you want to geek out and talk about anything related F1 I am always ready. I also watch Football my clubs are Tottenham Hotspur is my team in the Premier League and FC Barcelona in La Liga. I occasionally play the sport myself with friends.I also like music and try my best to sing while with friends and family.</p>
